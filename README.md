Welcome!

I created this project to sharpen my coding skill.

In this file, I'm going to tell you everything starting from the tools that I used, and much more.

The challenge

My challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
Any input field is empty
The email address is not formatted correctly
Toggle the password visibility
Know the length of their password (without making them count it by themselves)
